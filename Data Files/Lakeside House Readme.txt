Move into the wonderful Lakeside House situated on the shores of Lake Amaya! If you have a good
eye, you may be able to find the hints revealing some of the building's history.

To reach the house, start in Pelagiad and head north until you reach water. Once there look to
your left and you should see the house. It uses the House Hlaalu architecture. To get in, you'll
need the key. The key is inside a sack, and the sack can be found in amonsgt the rocks in front of the
front door.
