--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Thank you for downloading :)

Version: 1.2.1
Requires Morrowind patched to the latest version.

===========
Description
===========

Move into the wonderful Lakeside House situated on the shores of Lake Amaya! If you have a good
eye, you may be able to find the hints revealing some of the building's history.

To reach the house, start in Pelagiad and head north until you reach water. Once there look to
your left and you should see the house. It uses the House Hlaalu architecture. To get in, you'll
need the key and that's inside a sack. Which can be found in amonsgt the rocks in front of the door
to the house.

Anyone returning to the house will find that the sack is much closer than it used to be, and hopefully
easier to find.

===============
Updating to 1.2.1
===============

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSIDE THE HOUSE:

Perform a clean save first, then update to v1.2.1

OTHERWISE:

Simply remove the old Lakeside House.esp from your Data Files folder, and place the new one in its place.

When loading your save game, Morrowind will take note of the change and ask if you would like to continue
loading the saved game. Click yes. Lakeside House 1.2.1 does not make any changes that might adversly effect
your game.

============
Installation
============

To install, just extract into the Morrowind/Data Files directory.
Then start the Morrowind Launcher, go to Data Files, and make sure your choice is 
checked to activate.
The mod has been cleaned of GMST's with the Enchanted Editor.


To uninstall, start the Morrowind Launcher, go to Data Files, uncheck the plug-in.
Then delete Lakeside House.esp from the Morrowind/Data Files directory.

If using Vortex or MO, then do as you normally would.


===============
Incompatibility
===============

Any mod that is situated within the exterior cell (-1, -6) may be incompatible with this mod, in
particular towards the southern end.

The two levelled creatures that were situated by the house have been moved to the eastern end of the
cell, so any mods that modify levelled creatures should not be incompatible unless they specifically
move those two references.

If there are any I will list any here once I know of them. Please contact me if you find any incompatibilities.


====================
Known Issues or Bugs
====================

As far as I know there are currently no known bugs or issues. Please contact me if 
you find any. Or post a bug report on the Nexus Mods page.
