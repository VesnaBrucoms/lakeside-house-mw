# Lakeside House

This is a recent backup of an old mod that I had developed and released for the game Morrowind back in 2014.
The original download page can be found on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43151). Below
is the original description for the mod.

Move into the wonderful Lakeside House situated on the shores of Lake Amaya! If you have a good eye, you may
be able to find the hints revealing some of the building's history.

To reach the house, start in Pelagiad and head north until you reach water. Once there look to your left and
you should see the house. It uses the House Hlaalu architecture. To get in, you'll need the key. The key is
inside a sack, and the sack can be found in amongst the rocks in front of the front door.
